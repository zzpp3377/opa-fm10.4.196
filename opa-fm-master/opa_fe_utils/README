Network library to support out-of-band queries to the FE through oib_utils and opafequery.

It contains utility functions for OOB connections and packet sending to the
Fabric Executive (FE).

opa_fe_utils is located under OPENIB_FF. It acts as an API layer under the oib_utils
layer, enabling queries to the SA and PA through the FE. Because of the functionality
provided, tools that interface at the oib_utils layer can make queries while
situated on an out-of-band host. opafequery also makes use of osf_fe_utils as a
lower layer for communicating with the FE, but it does so directly, rather than invoking 
oib_utils functions. 

The following source files (with associated header files) are included in the
library. A brief summary of each file's provided functionality is given below.

fe_connections.c:
- out-of-band connection/disconnection
- out-of-band packet sending and receiving 

fe_net.c:
- opening/closing and reading/writing sockets 
- creating, sending, receving, and destroying NetBlobs
- connection list management
- error handling

fe_net_blob.c:
- creating and freeing NetBlobs  
- updating "bytes sent" metadata

fe_net_queue.c:
- initialization, enqueuing/dequeuing, peeking, and empty checks for NetBlob queues 


Additionally, the two header files listed below are included for convenience.

fe_error_types.h:
- contains generic, configuration, subnet, performance, device, baseboard, and
  unsolicited error types 

fe_protocol.h:
- contains definitions for OOB packets and header, as well as byte-swapping macros
