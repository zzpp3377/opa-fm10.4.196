# [ICS VERSION STRING: unknown]
# This file lists all the Intel Externally Managed Switches
#
# specify one line per switch of the form guid,nodeDesc,distance
#  guid - node guid of the switch
#  nodeDesc - optional node description which should be programmed into
#      the switch by FastFabric.  It is recommended to supply a unique
#      nodeDesc for each switch to simplify management of the cluster.
#  distance - optional relative distance of the switch from the FastFabric node
#      this is used by reboot operations to first operate on switches furthest
#      from the FastFabric node.
#      Nodes without a distance specified will be treated as furthest.
# For fabrics with multiple IB subnets, the local hfi and port to use may be
# specified as: guid:hfi:port,nodeDesc,distance.
# See the FastFabric Manual for more info
#
# The opagenswitches tool can be used to query the SM and generate a list of
# Externally Managed switches in the proper form for this file.
