OPA Fabric Manager
-------------------

* To build the RPM and SRPM:

  1. mkdir -p $HOME/rpmbuild/{SOURCES,RPMS,SRPMS}
  2. ./Esm/update_opa-fm_spec.sh opa-fm.spec.in opa-fm.spec
  3. tar czf $HOME/rpmbuild/SOURCES/opa-fm.tar.gz --exclude-vcs .
  4. rpmbuild -ba ./opa-fm.spec

  This will build the opa-fm RPM in $HOME/rpmbuild/RPMS(architecture)/

  This will also create a opa-fm-debuginfo RPM, which by default contains basic
  symbol information - see blow on how to build with full debugging information.

* To build in this directory:

1. cd Esm; ./fmbuild


* How to include debugging symbols:

  export BUILD_CONFIG=debug

  prior to either of the aforementioned build procedures.
