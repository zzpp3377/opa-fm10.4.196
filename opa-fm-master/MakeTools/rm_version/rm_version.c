/*!
Remove the version string from a .uid or Linux/Cygwin/MIPS a.out file

This scans the last 1024 bytes of the given file for a
version string which starts with "version_marker:"
If the pattern is matched, the file is truncated such that
"version_marker:" and all bytes which follow it are
removed from the file.

THIS SHOULD ONLY BE RUN AGAINST FILES WHICH prep MAY HAVE
APPENDED A VERSION STRING TO.  FOR OTHER FILES WHICH PREP
EDITS WITH mcs OR sed, THIS MAY CORRUPT THE FILE.

The scan for "version_marker" is done by a reverse scan
of the last 1024 bytes of the file, it stops on the first match

@heading Usage
	rm_version [-m version_marker] file ...
@param version_marker - version marker to look for, default is
		"ICS VERSION STRING"
@param file - name of a file which may have a version string
		appended to it
