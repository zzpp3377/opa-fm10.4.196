 *
 *	The following rules apply for all SMP buffer usage:
 *		* Cut down the requirements on system memory is reduced by half as there is no
 *		  copy administered between Sends and Receives. The same SMP buffers are 
 *		  passed to/from the hardware. All SMP buffers come from registered memory.
 *		* The buffers are not tied down to a particular Channel Adapter. Hence they can
 *		  be sent to or received from any CA. The memory registration is taken care of
 *		  by the SMA.
 *		* The buffers are not required to be maintained by the Subnet Manager. All
 *		  tracking is done by the SMA. 
 *		* Once a buffer is submitted by a SmaPost or SmaSetLocal call to the SMA, it
 *		  will be not returned back.
 *		* There is no rule maintained as to the order of these buffers. The Subnet Manager 
 *		  cannot except the same buffers to be passed in by the SMA.
 *		* All buffers allocated and returned through any send/receive calls hold the same
 *		  size and is equal to the size of a MAD structure of 256 bytes.
 *		* A buffer once allocated from pool can be rturned back to pool by SmaPost() and
 *		  SmaReturnToPool().
