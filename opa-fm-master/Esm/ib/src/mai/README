MAD message passing interface used by the FM


This directory contains the management API code.  The prefix for this code
is 'mai_'.  The following files exist:


mai.c
  Contains code to implement all of the management API functions.  Also has
a large number of internal utility routines.  This module contains all the
static data.


maif.c
  Holds all the code that understands the exact semantics of filters.  It is
used only by other management API code.


maic.c
  Holds functions that convert between endian and wordsize opaque binary
data streams and the Mai_t and Filter_t structures used by the mai
subsystem.  These 'helper' routines are available to the ib_send_sma
and ib_recv_sma implementations that cross such boundaries.


mai_l.h
  Holds structure definitions and function prototypes for internal use only
items.


../include/mai_g.h
  Holds data structure definitions, defines, and function prototypes for 
all the code that can be used by external agents and managers.

../include/cs_g.h
  Contains the structure definition Mai_t used by both clients of the
management API and common services routines that send and receive MADs.
