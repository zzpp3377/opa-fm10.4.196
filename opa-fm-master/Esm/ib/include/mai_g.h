/*
 * Mai_t
 *   This structure is the primary interchange for the
 * Management API and all the glue layers. It is created by managers
 * and agents on one side of the pipe and IB hardware on the other.
 *
 * active
 *   This bit field describes which parts of Mai_t contain
 * real information. Manager and agents use it to communicate with
 * hardware on wire level protocol.  The receive side
 * code+hardware use it to communicate with agents and managers how
 * much of the data is valid.
 *
 * type
 *   There are 3 types of mai_mad data objects:
 *     EXTERNAL    send + receive	Contains a MAD for the wire
 *     INTERNAL    send + receive	Used for inter-agent communication
 *   When an agent/manager sends a MAD of type INTERNAL, that data chunk
 * is transported to the very bottom of the stream and queued to
 * the incoming MAD chain. As it passes back up the stack, the
 * various fields are matched against every channels filters and
 * the MAD is duplicated on the input queue of each of them.
 *
 * dev
 *   When there are multiple FIs in a system, the dev parameter is
 * used to select them. FIs are numbered consecutively from 0 to
 * n-1 where there are n adapters. The dev fields must be >0 except
 * when constructing filters. dev==-1 --> MAI_FILTER_ANY.
 *
 * port
 *   Switches use the port parameter to select the correct output
 * port for PERMISSIVE MADs.  Multi-port channel adapters use the
 * port to indicate which port in the FI should be used.  The port
 * fields must be >0 except when constructing filters.
 * ports==-1 --> MAI_FILTER_ANY
 *
 * addrInfo
 *  addressing information for the MAD packet
 *
 * base
 *   Contains the standard MAD header
 *
 * datasize
 *   Contains the number of active bytes in data.
 *
 * data
 *   Optional fields at the end of the standard MAD header.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * NOTES:
 *   1. You must always preserve the order of the following fields
 *        - base
 *        - data
 *   2. Changes to the active masks (MAI_ACT_*) require updates to the
 *      filter-checking logic in maif.c

 * FUNCTION

 * DESCRIPTION
 *      This function will wait for a message to be posted to any of the handles 
 *      specified in argument.  It returns the index of the lowest handle
 *      that has a message on it, if a message is received before timeout.
 *      This index is posted to the location the user passed in, pointed
 *      by the location pfirst.
 * 
 * INPUTS
 *      ha      Array of handles returned from mai_open
 *      count   Number of handles in array.
 *      timout  How long to wait. 0 means return immediately
 *      pfirst  Where to post the index handle with message on in 
 *      maip    Where to post the MAD received on the handle
