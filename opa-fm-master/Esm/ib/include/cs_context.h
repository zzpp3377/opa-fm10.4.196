// FILE NAME
//    cs_context.h
//
// DESCRIPTION
//    Definitions for a generic context pool for reliable single packet 
//  comunications
//
//  There are three models for using this:
//  1. Simple state based operation with multiple concurrent requests and
//     a sequence initiated via callbacks.  This model is used by the PM.
//     A set of operations are started by a main thread.
//     Then callbacks process the responses and issue the next packet(s).
//     When all packets are done, the callback wakes up the main thread.
//  2. A "polling based" operation with multiple concurrent requests and
//     a sequence initiated by polling a resp_queue.  This model is used by
//     the SM for GuidInfo queries (sm_send_request_async_and_queue_rsp).
//     In this model a callback is not allowed.  The main thread issues one
//     or more packets.  As the responses complete (or timeout) the cntxt_entry
//     is put on the resp_queue.  The main thread polls or waits on the
//     resp_queue and processes the responses and decides when ti issue the
//     next packet.
//  3. A dispatcher operation with a work queue and a sequence initiated by
//     callbacks.  This is very similar to mode #1.  This model is used by the
//     SM for LFT and MFT sets.  The main thread puts outbound packets on a
//     dispatcher queue (sm_send_request_async_dispatch*).  Then callbacks
//     process the responses.  A dispatcher is also called periodically to
//     take items off the queue and issue new packets.  When the dispatcher
//     queue is empty an event is signalled which wakes the main thread.
//
//  In all the above models the cs_context can handle retries and timeouts.
//  As part of this design, care is taken to ensure that callers can depend
//  on eventually getting a callback.  As such there are no allocations
//  needed within the callback.  Even in model #1, care is taken by the
//  callbacks to ensure there is never an attempt to have more than
//  poolSize requests outstanding, hence the context can always provide an
//  entry to use for issuing the packet.
